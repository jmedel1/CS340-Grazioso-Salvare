# CS 340 – Grazioso Salvare Dashboard

This repo contains my final dashboard code and CRUD Python module for Project Two.  
The project connects a MongoDB database to an interactive dashboard built with Dash.

## Writing Maintainable and Adaptable Programs
I keep my code organized and readable by separating responsibilities. The CRUD Python module is an example, it handles all the database operations in one place. This made the dashboard easier to build because I didn’t need to repeat database logic in multiple files. This module could also be reused in future projects that need MongoDB access.

## My Approach to the Project
I broke the project into steps:

1. Set up MongoDB and load the data  
2. Build the CRUD module  
3. Pull the data into the dashboard  
4. Add filters, the table, the map, and the chart  

This project was different from past courses because it required connecting several parts together (database, Python code, and the visual dashboard). In future projects, I would follow the same approach: plan first, build in pieces, and test along the way.

## What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists solve problems with data and software.  
In this project, the dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare quickly find and filter animals for different rescue needs and see their locations. Tools like this can save time, reduce manual work, and help organizations make better decisions.
